# BusRush

BusRush is web and mobile application that allows users to monitor bus metrics such as delays in real-time. It hopes to solve the existing transparency issue attached to public bus service, where commuters aren’t aware of the current state of the bus they want to take. In a more administrative perspective, it can provide tools for control and analysis of a bus fleet, helping on the decision making process. 

The system revolves around the Spring Boot framework, which provides a bridge between the frontend and backend components.
